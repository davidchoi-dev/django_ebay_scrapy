# Purpose:
< eBay Scrapy can help the eBay sellers to understand the marketplace with Keyword Analysis. >

To quickly/statistically understand the market with certain keywords,
to understand how to complete the new product information.

1. When you search type word(s) on ebBy search, you can see the popular/reasonable products at the top page.
Actually, the formula of being the popular products is similar as SNS.
The way of making our new products up to the top page is the "Organic Advertisement" without paying anything.

2. Before the sellers upload their products, it is important to understand the "Organic Advertisement" tactic.
Using the proper keywords on the product title, matching the certain categories are couple of the major tactics.
Therefore, ebay_scrapy can help you to decide if you will upload the product, and how you need to write the product details.
